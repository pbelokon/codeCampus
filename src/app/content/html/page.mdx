# Welcome HTML!

<Brake />

HTML is the HyperText MarkUp Language. It allows us to write content in a document, just as we would in a file.
Unlike regular text in HTML we have to mark up the text of our document with layout information that it's contents should follow.

Think of HTML as a framing of the house, it will shape how other components of the house will lay on it.

HTML's markup consists of this 4 elements:

    - tag: separated from regular content, tags are special text(names) wrapped in "< >", for example image  "<img>"
    - element: everything from an opening tag to the closing tag, for example: <h1>Hello</h1>  elements are made of 2 tags and content in between them
    - attribute: optional characteristics of an element defined using the style name  or name="value, for example <p id="mystory"> </p> full list (url).
    - entity: spacial text that should now be confused for HTML markup. entity begins with & and ends with ; . For example , if you need to use the < character in your document,
    you need to use &lt;  FUll list

First page ever created Tim bERNERS-lEE

 <html>
    <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8">

    </head>

    <body>
     < !-- this is a comment -->
        <h1> Hello World</h1>
    </body>

 </html>

this is a content -> just in word

<p> - tag
<p>This is an element</p> - element
<p id="content">This is an element</p> - element with attribute putting extra information to it

HTML is a markup language that web developer use to structure and describe the content of the webpage (not a programming language )
we use it to describe content of the page

<p>HTML is a markup language </p>
entire thing is an element 
there is an opening and closing tag
content is inside content of the element in this example text. But it might be another element(child element)
SOme elements have no content(e.g <img>)
closing tag is omitted when element has no content
